# carla-greater

GREATER and CARLA -- two synthetic datasets that are released alongside our CVPR 2022 paper "Revealing Occlusions with 4D Neural Fields".

See the [main repository here](https://github.com/basilevh/occlusions-4d).

<!---
Please note that the depth map in GREATER is actually the distance from the camera plane, not the camera itself.

Code coming soon!
